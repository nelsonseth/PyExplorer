# Python Explorer

Developmental build of an experimental python object exploration tool and interface. (work in progress)

Summary
-------
This idea stems from my own curiousity about existing python packages both as a beginner as well as someone who tends to want to know why something is the way that it is. When presented with new packages, we generally have two options to learn about them... read the docs or explore the raw code. This tool is intended to live somewhere in the middle of those two options. This will definitely not be a replacement for the docs, nor will it give you all the information possible by going to the source code. 

My hope is to quickly answer questions like what are the basic parts of a package? What are all the functions or things that are available for a given object? How do the pieces fit together? 

Oftentimes, the only reason we know about a certain class/function/method is because we had a direct need for it and googled a similar example. While useful in the moment, this can result in a lack of awareness for other potentially useful portions of the code. Having a tool that allows you to quckly scan through a listing of available things generally encourages further curiosity and understanding.... this is my current goal.
