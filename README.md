# Python Explorer
Developmental build of an experimental python object exploration tool and interface.

This idea stems from my own curiousity about existing python packages both as a beginner as well as someone who tends to want to know why something is the way that it is. When presented with new packages, we generally have two options to learn about it... read the docs or explore the raw code. This is intended to live somewhere in the middle of those two options. My hope is to quickly answer questions like what are the basic parts of this package? What are all the functions that are available? How do the pieces fit together?
